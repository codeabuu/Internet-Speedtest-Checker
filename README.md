INTERNET SPEED TEST USING SPEEDTEST PYTHON SCRIPT
....................................................
....................................................

This is a simple Python script that utilizes the "speedtest" module to perform an internet speed test. The script measures the download speed, upload speed, and ping (latency) to the best Speedtest.net server and displays the results in megabits per second (Mbps).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system
- "speedtest" module installed (you can install it using `pip install speedtest-cli`)

## How to Use

1. Clone the Repository

   Clone this repository to your local machine using Git or download the script directly from the GitHub page.

2. Install the Required Module

   Ensure that the "speedtest" module is installed in your Python environment. If you don't have it, install it using the following command:

   
   pip install speedtest-cli
   

3. Run the Script

   Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the `speedtest_script.py` file.

   Run the script using Python 3:

   ```
   python3 speedtest_script.py
   ```

4. View the Results

   The script will initiate the internet speed test and display the results once the test is completed. The results will include:

   - Best server for the speed test
   - Download speed in Mbps
   - Upload speed in Mbps
   - Ping (latency) in milliseconds

   The output will look similar to the following:

   ```
   Best server: speedtest.example.com
   Download speed is: XX.XX Mbps
   Upload speed is: XX.XX Mbps
   Ping: X.XXX ms
   ```

## Customizing the Script

If you want to test the speed using a specific website link, you can modify the `target_website` variable in the script. Replace `"example.com"` with the desired website link. The script will then attempt to find the best Speedtest.net server that matches the given website.

Please note that the speed test results can vary based on network conditions, server load, and other factors. It's advisable to run the test multiple times and at different times of the day to get a more accurate representation of your internet speed.
